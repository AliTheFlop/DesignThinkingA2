                        <h3>Major Reforestation Projects Take Root Across the City</h3>
                        <p>
                            Brisbane is going green‚Äîliterally. As part of its long-term sustainability strategy, Brisbane City Council has announced a large-scale reforestation campaign targeting degraded and under-utilised lands across the metropolitan area. The project focuses on replanting native tree species in areas such as the Brisbane River corridor, the western suburbs, and community bushland reserves. The Council aims to improve biodiversity, provide urban cooling, and combat the effects of climate change‚Äîparticularly heat island effects in densely built environments. ‚ÄúThis isn't just about planting trees‚Äîit's about reconnecting ecosystems,‚Äù said Councillor Jane Thompson, Chair of Environment, Parks and Sustainability. ‚ÄúWe're restoring critical koala habitats and reinforcing green corridors that allow native wildlife to move safely through the city.‚Äù The project has been designed in collaboration with ecologists, Traditional Custodians, and local community groups. Volunteers will play a key role, with weekend planting events scheduled throughout the year. The council also intends to involve schools and local businesses in the effort. Beyond environmental benefits, the reforestation program will contribute to improved public health by reducing airborne pollutants and increasing shade coverage in public spaces. It also supports Brisbane's commitment to becoming a carbon-neutral city by 2050. So far, more than 80,000 trees have been planted since the program's pilot phase began in 2023, with early results showing increased bird populations and soil regeneration in several sites. To learn more or get involved, residents are encouraged to visit the Council's Green Brisbane portal or attend one of the upcoming community planting days.
