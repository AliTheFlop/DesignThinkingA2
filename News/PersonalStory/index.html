                            <h2>Brisbane's Heatwaves Are Changing My Life</h2>
                            <p>I've lived in Brisbane my whole life. Grew up in a Queenslander in Moorooka, playing footy in the street barefoot, getting sunburnt every summer, and eating mangoes under the rotary clothesline. Summer used to be my favourite time of year. It meant school holidays, river swims, and Christmas with my whole extended family sweating around a backyard barbecue. But the last few years have been different. It's like summer never ends — not in a nostalgic, carefree way, but in an exhausting, inescapable way. In 2023, I remember a night in March when the temperature didn't drop below 28 degrees. No breeze, no relief. We had three fans on, all windows open, and still couldn't sleep. My partner had to take our toddler to the hospital the next day because he was struggling to breathe — turns out the heat and humidity had triggered a severe asthma attack. Then came the floods. Again. We thought 2011 was the worst of it, but 2022 and 2024 proved us wrong. Our neighbour's house in Rocklea went under twice in 18 months. Their insurance didn't pay out the second time. They left. The house is still there — boarded up, mould crawling up the walls. Even the local wildlife's changed. We used to hear frogs every night after rain. Now it's mostly silence. The jacarandas still bloom in October, but the flowers drop faster. And this year, the bats came in mid-winter — completely out of season, disoriented, collapsing from heat exhaustion in our backyard. What gets to me the most is how normalised it's all become. “Another record high today,” the news says, like it's just part of life. But I remember when 35 degrees was shocking — now it's routine. My mum talks about retiring up north, but I worry what kind of north Queensland she's heading to. Cyclones are getting stronger, more unpredictable. My little sister just moved back to Brisbane after two years in Lismore. She lost everything in the floods there. We've started making changes — solar panels, shorter showers, trying to eat local. But it often feels like bailing water out of a sinking boat with a teaspoon. The heat isn't just physical anymore. It's emotional. It wears you down. Brisbane still has its beauty. The river still glows bronze at sunset, and the storms still roll in with drama and power. But the climate crisis has shifted something fundamental — it's made our seasons unreliable, our homes fragile, and our futures uncertain. I miss the Brisbane I grew up in. And I worry that if we don't act fast, my son will grow up thinking this version — the endless summer, the flooded streets, the smoky skies — is just how things have always been..</p>
