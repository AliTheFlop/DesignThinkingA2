                            <h2>Brisbane's Heatwaves Are Changing My Life</h2>
                          <div class="story-text">
                            <p>I've lived in Brisbane my whole life, growing up in a Queenslander in Moorooka. Summers used to mean school holidays, river swims, and family barbecues filled with laughter and sweat. But now, summer feels endless and exhausting rather than carefree. In March 2023, the temperature stayed above 28°C all night—no breeze, no relief. The heat and humidity triggered a severe asthma attack in my toddler, landing him in hospital. Then came floods far worse than 2011; a neighbour's house in Rocklea flooded twice in 18 months and was abandoned after insurance refused to pay. Even the local wildlife has changed—frogs are silent after rain, jacaranda flowers fall faster, and bats appeared disoriented and collapsing from heat exhaustion in mid-winter.Record highs are now routine, and the climate crisis feels shockingly normalised. My mum talks about retiring up north, but I worry what kind of future she's heading into with stronger, unpredictable cyclones. My sister recently returned to Brisbane after losing everything in the Lismore floods. We've started installing solar panels, taking shorter showers, and eating more local produce, but it often feels like bailing out a sinking boat with a teaspoon. The heat isn't just physical anymore—it wears you down emotionally. Brisbane still holds its beauty: the river glows bronze at sunset, and storms roll in with their usual drama. But the climate crisis has shifted something fundamental—it has made our seasons unreliable, our homes fragile, and our futures uncertain. I miss the Brisbane I grew up in, and I fear that if we don't act fast, my son will grow up believing this endless summer, flooded streets, and smoky skies are just how life has always been.</p>
