          <h2>Brisbane's Heatwaves Are Changing My Life</h2>
          <p>I've lived in Brisbane my whole life, and I've always loved our warm weather. But over the past few years, something's changed — and not in a good way. Summer doesn't just feel hot anymore, it feels extreme. Last December, I remember checking the forecast and seeing a full week of 36°C days in a row. I live in an older Queenslander home without air conditioning, and by the third day, I couldn't sleep at night. My dog was panting constantly, and even my plants started wilting no matter how much I watered them. I spoke to my neighbours, and we all agreed: this isn't normal. We're seeing longer, more intense heatwaves, less rainfall, and more bushfire warnings than we used to. It's scary. What really hit me was hearing from my elderly aunt in Logan, who ended up in hospital from heat exhaustion. She's always been active and independent, but she said it felt like her body just shut down from the heat. Climate change isn't some far-off problem — it's already here. It's making life harder, especially for people who don't have the money to cool their homes or the ability to adapt quickly. This has motivated me to take action. I started attending local climate workshops, switched to using public transport more often, and joined a local tree-planting group. It's a small step, but I'm hopeful that if more of us speak up and do something — no matter how small — we can start to make a real difference for Brisbane's future.</p>

            <h2>A Fisherman's Fight: Witnessing the Decline of the Brisbane River</h2>
          <p>I've fished the Brisbane River for over 30 years. My name's Ray, and I've lived in West End since I was a teenager. When I first started, the water was clearer, and you could spot schools of bream and flathead near the banks. Locals would picnic along the river, and kids swam off pontoons in summer. But over the years, I've seen things change—and not for the better. After heavy rain, stormwater drains flush rubbish straight into the river. I've pulled out plastic bags, bottles, syringes, and worse. In the 2011 floods, sewage overflowed into the river, and the smell lingered for weeks. The fish are fewer, smaller, and many have lesions or look unhealthy. Once, I caught a mullet with a bloated belly and discoloured skin—I threw it straight back. I've watched new developments go up along the banks, but the infrastructure doesn't seem to handle the runoff. Construction sites leave behind silty messes that wash into the river after every storm. I've tried raising concerns with council, but there's little follow-up. Despite everything, I still fish. But now it's more about bearing witness. The river used to be the heart of this city. Now, it's a dumping ground. I just hope someone listens before it's too far gone.</p>
