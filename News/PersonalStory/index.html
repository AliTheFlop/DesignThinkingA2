        <h2>Brisbane's Heatwaves Are Changing My Life</h2>
        <p> I've lived in Brisbane my whole life, and I've always loved our warm weather. But over the past few years, something's changed — and not in a good way. Summer doesn't just feel hot anymore, it feels extreme.

Last December, I remember checking the forecast and seeing a full week of 36°C days in a row. I live in an older Queenslander home without air conditioning, and by the third day, I couldn't sleep at night. My dog was panting constantly, and even my plants started wilting no matter how much I watered them.

I spoke to my neighbours, and we all agreed: this isn't normal. We're seeing longer, more intense heatwaves, less rainfall, and more bushfire warnings than we used to. It's scary.

What really hit me was hearing from my elderly aunt in Logan, who ended up in hospital from heat exhaustion. She's always been active and independent, but she said it felt like her body just shut down from the heat.

Climate change isn't some far-off problem — it's already here. It's making life harder, especially for people who don't have the money to cool their homes or the ability to adapt quickly.

This has motivated me to take action. I started attending local climate workshops, switched to using public transport more often, and joined a local tree-planting group. It's a small step, but I'm hopeful that if more of us speak up and do something — no matter how small — we can start to make a real difference for Brisbane's future.</p>
