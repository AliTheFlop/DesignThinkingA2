                            The Climate Challenge is an interactive way to learn about climate change. You complete a series of activities, including a card flip game, an infographic task, and a real-life action, to fill out your checklist. The goal is to reinforce knowledge and spark curiosity about climate-related issues in a fun and dynamic way. Once you complete your checklist, you can submit it and share your pledge.
